1;0:00:00,000;0:00:03,000;1;she wants open borders people are gonna pour into our country
2;0:00:03,000;0:00:08,000;1;people are gonna come in from Syria she wants five hundred and fifty percent
3;0:00:08,000;0:00:10,000;1;more people than Barack Obama 
4;0:00:10,000;0:00:14,000;0;and he has thousands and thousands of people they have no idea where they come from
5;0:00:14,000;0:00:20,000;0;and you see we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country
6;0:00:20,000;0:00:23,000;0;she won't even mention the words and neither will President Obama
7;0:00:23,000;0:00:27,000;1;so I just want to tell you she wants open borders now we can talk about Putin
8;0:00:27,000;0:00:32,000;1;I don't know Putin he said nice things about me if we got along well that would be good
9;0:00:32,000;0:00:38,000;1;if Russia and the United States got along well and went after Isis that would be good
10;0:00:38,000;0:00:44,000;1;he has no respect for her he has no respect for our president and I'll tell you what we're in very serious trouble
11;0:00:44,000;0:00:50,000;0;because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads
12;0:00:50,000;0:00:57,000;0;1,800 by the way where they expanded and we didn't 1800 nuclear warheads
13;0:00:57,000;0:01:05,000;0;and she's playing chicken look from everything I see has no respect for this person
14;0:01:05,000;0:01:08,000;0;well that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of united states
15;0:01:08,000;0:01:11,000;0;no puppet, no puppet
16;0:01:11,000;0:01:13,000;1;and it's pretty clear, it's pretty clear you won't admit
16;0:01:11,000;0:01:13,000;0;you are the puppet
17;0:01:13,000;0:01:18,000;1;that Russians have engaged in cyber attacks against the United States of America
17;0:01:13,000;0:01:18,000;0;no, you are puppet
18;0:01:18,000;0:01:24,000;0;that you encouraged espionage against our people
19;0:01:24,000;0:01:29,000;0;that you are willing to spout the Putin line sign up for his wish list
20;0:01:29,000;0:01:36,000;1;rake up NATO do whatever he wants to do and that you continue to get help from him
21;0:01:36,000;0:01:40,000;1;because he has a very clear favorite in this race
22;0:01:40,000;0:01:47,000;0;so I think that this is such an unprecedented situation we've never had
23;0:01:47,000;0:01:51,000;1;a foreign government trying to interfere in our election we have 17
24;0:01:51,000;0:01:58,000;0;17 intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that
25;0:01:58,000;0:02:04,000;1;these espionage attacks these cyber attacks come from the highest levels of the Kremlin
26;0:02:04,000;0:02:07,000;1;and they are designed to influence our election
27;0:02:07,000;0:02:10,000;1; I find that deeply disturbing
28;0:02:10,000;0:02:14,000;1;and I think it's time you'll take the same cause if
28;0:02:10,000;0:02:14,000;0;she has no idea whether it's Russia China or anybody else
29;0:02:14,000;0:02:24,000;1;I am not quoting myself, I'm quoting 17, 17 until you doubt 17 military and civilian agencies as well
29;0:02:14,000;0:02:24,000;0;she has no idea, you have no idea. and our country has no idea
30;0:02:24,000;0:02:28,000;0;he would rather believe Vladimir Putin
30;0:02:24,000;0:02:28,000;1;yeah, I doubt it, I doubt it
31;0:02:28,000;0:02:31,000;1;then, the military and civilian intelligence professionals
32;0:02:31,000;0:02:33,000;1;who are sworn to protect us
